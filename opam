synopsis: "RISC-V core platform libraries for MirageOS"
description: """
This package provides the MirageOS `OS` library for
RISC-V targets, which handles the main loop
and timers. It also provides the low level C startup code and C stubs required
by the OCaml code.

The OCaml runtime and C runtime required to support it are provided separately
by the [ocaml-freestanding](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-freestanding) package.
